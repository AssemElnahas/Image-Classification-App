Image Classification with Streamlit and TensorFlow
This is a simple image classification app built using Streamlit and a pre-trained TensorFlow model (MobileNetV2). The app allows users to upload an image and receive predictions about the image's content.

Features:
Upload an image in JPG, PNG, or JPEG format.
The app uses MobileNetV2, a pre-trained deep learning model, to classify the image.
Displays the top 3 predictions with their confidence scores.
Requirements:
To run this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

Streamlit: To create the interactive web interface.
TensorFlow: To use the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for image classification.
Pillow: For image handling.
You can install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit tensorflow Pillow
How to Run the App:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Create a Python environment (optional but recommended) and activate it.
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit tensorflow Pillow
Run the Streamlit app:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run image_classification_app.py
The app will open in your default web browser, where you can upload an image and see the classification results.
How the App Works:
Image Upload: The user uploads an image using the file uploader in the app.
Image Processing: The uploaded image is resized to 224x224 pixels (required by MobileNetV2) and preprocessed for classification.
Prediction: The app uses MobileNetV2, a deep learning model pre-trained on ImageNet, to predict the content of the image.
Results: The top 3 predictions are displayed along with their respective confidence scores.
Model Used:
The model used for image classification is MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network model pre-trained on ImageNet. This model is designed for mobile and edge devices while maintaining good accuracy for image classification tasks.

Example Output:
After uploading an image, youâ€™ll receive output like this:

yaml
Copy code
Prediction:
1. zebra: 98.45%
2. giraffe: 1.55%
3. elephant: 0.00%
